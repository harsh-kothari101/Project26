Hey! Chef

I am Harsh Kothari Your new cook recipe maker!!,Today in the morning I have a great idea to make a Chocolate Ball from biscuits like Parle-G, Hide & Seek, Monaco etc.

So to make Chocolate Ball from Biscuits, follow the step:-

1. Mash the biscuits in the mikshi to make a powder of the biscuits.
2. Boil 3 cup of milk for 5-10 minutes than take 1 cup of Bourn-Vita,   and mix them for a chocolaty look and taste.
3. Then make Dough of the powder and the chocolaty syrup, and then make ball from the Dough

That`s it chef!

Thank You!!!
